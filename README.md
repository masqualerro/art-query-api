# Art Query API :art: :globe_with_meridians:

## About
This API, powered by [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/), serves as the backend for my [Art Query Web App](https://github.com/masqualerro/art-query-rebuild). It encompasses modules for authentication, user management, and saving artworks, providing a comprehensive platform for art enthusiasts.

Additionally, it integrates the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) to offer insights on users' saved artworks, enhancing the overall experience and understanding of art.

The API and its corresponding database are hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

The frontend for the web app can be found here: [Art Query Web App](https://github.com/masqualerro/art-query-rebuild).
